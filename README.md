# CompileNotingTools

`CompileNoting` is a fancy formatter for [*Mathematica*](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). It generates a sidenoted **Input Cell** of the inputted `CompiledFunction`.

Please refer to the **[documentation] CompileNotingTools.nb** for detailed usage and examples.

**Note:** The new function `Activate` is used in the package, so it will only work for versions after 10.0.
